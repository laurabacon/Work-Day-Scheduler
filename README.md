# API Work-Day-Scheduler 

## Description

In this project, you will see a calendar for the 9-5 workday. You will see that the text boxes for the first few hours (9am and 10am) are greyed out because those are in the past. In the current hour (11am) you will see a red background within the text box. Finally, for the future hours (12pm-5pm) you will see a green backgorund for the text box indicating that those are in the future. You can enter text into the text boxes and click the 'save' icon to the right to save your text. If you decide to refresh the page, your enteries will stay because they are being stored in local storage. If you would like to clear this, you just need to go into your local storage and clear it out.
